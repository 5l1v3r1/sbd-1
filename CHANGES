1.36: Sep 17 2004: bug fix + the -w option
    - Made the write descriptor that's part of one of the pipes used for the
      -e execution option non-blocking to prevent sbd from infinitely hanging
      (under Linux at least, seems to work fine under NetBSD though).
    - If stdin is /dev/null (or simply nothing) sbd won't exit when in normal
      mode (without the -e option). This was a really stupid bug - discovered
      while running an sbd process from cron.
    - Added a timeout feature, the -w option. Now it's possible to have sbd
      automatically disconnect if there hasn't been any activity on the wire
      for n seconds. Feature is currently only available in the Unix version
      of sbd (not win32).

1.33: Jul 23 2004: -s option
    - added the -s option to have sbd invoke a shell, nothing else. if sbd is
      setuid 0, it'll invoke a root shell.

1.31: Jun 20 2004: Added setuid(geteuid()) code and command line wiping.
    - if sbd is setuid (chmod 4755 or 6755), sbd will do setuid(geteuid()) on
      Unix-like operating systems. feature added to offer root shells during
      pen-tests.
    - the host, port and command to execute (-e option) specified on the
      command line are wiped with spaces in order to hide them from the
      process list on Unix-like operating systems (e.g. "ps auxww", "ps -Af",
      e.g.). the -k option was wiped with stars (*) before, but now it's all
      wiped with spaces (0x20) instead.

1.27: Jun 13 2004: Bugfixes and features.
    - implemented Christophe Devine's optimized AES-CBC-128 code
    - resolved disconnect-on-large-transfer-bug in doexec_win32.h
    - added the -m option (snooping)
    - added the -n option (numeric-only IP addresses)

1.23: Jun 9 2004: Minor bugfix.
    - resolved const char* segfault bug (read-only memory) if EXECPROG != NULL

1.21: Jun 8 2004: Initial release.
